### What is The Aggregate

(The Aggregate)[https://theaggregate.substack.com/] is a weekly newsletter I run that is focused on the analysis and visulization of unique datasets, from labor strikes in China to analyzing Pitchforks ranking of the top 200 songs of the 2010s.

All code and data used to create the visualizations for different editions of The Aggregate is archived here for future usage. This provides not only data that other people can use to check my analysis, but provide the base for the posibility of people using this data for various projects.
